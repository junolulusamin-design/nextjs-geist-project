# Detailed Implementation Plan for OSIS Election Website

This plan covers the creation of a multi‐page Next.js website for an OSIS election with two candidates. The website will include a landing page with candidate cards, a vote submission mechanism via an API endpoint, and a results page. All UI elements will use modern typography, spacing, and layout via Tailwind CSS (included via the CDN script) without using external icon libraries or non-approved images.

---

## Dependent Files and New Files

1. **New File: src/app/layout.tsx**
   - **Purpose:** Provide a consistent layout with header, navigation, and footer for all pages.
   - **Changes/Steps:**
     - Create a React layout component that wraps all pages.
     - Import the global stylesheet "globals.css".
     - In the `<head>`, add the Tailwind CDN script using `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`.
     - Add a header with navigation links to Home (`/`) and Results (`/result`).
     - Ensure the layout is responsive and uses modern spacing and typography.
     - Include proper error boundaries or fallback UI in case a page fails to load.

2. **New File: src/app/page.tsx**
   - **Purpose:** The landing page displaying the two candidate cards and allowing users to vote.
   - **Changes/Steps:**
     - Mark the file as a Client Component by including `"use client";` at the top.
     - Define candidate data objects for Candidate A and Candidate B (including names, descriptions, and vote IDs such as "candidateA" and "candidateB").
     - For each candidate, render a card using in-project UI components (e.g., card.tsx, button.tsx) styled with Tailwind classes.
     - Use `<img>` tags with the following attributes:
       - For Candidate A:  
         `src="https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Candidate+A+Profile"`  
         `alt="Profile+picture+of+Candidate+A+for+OSIS+election+with+professional+portrait+style"`  
         Include an `onError` handler to reset the image (e.g., assign a fallback placeholder).
       - For Candidate B:  
         `src="https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Candidate+B+Profile"`  
         `alt="Profile+picture+of+Candidate+B+for+OSIS+election+displaying+a+clear+and+professional+image"`  
         Include the same error fallback.
     - Add a “Vote” button on each card. When clicked:
       - Check if the user has already voted (using localStorage flag "voted") and prevent multiple votes.
       - Trigger a client-side function that sends a POST request to the `/api/vote` endpoint with the selected candidate ID.
       - Display success confirmation (or error messages using alert components) based on the API response.
     - Handle network errors and update UI state accordingly.

3. **New File: src/app/api/vote/route.ts**
   - **Purpose:** Create the API endpoint for vote submission and retrieving vote counts.
   - **Changes/Steps:**
     - Implement two HTTP methods:
       - **POST:**  
         - Parse JSON from the request body for a `candidateId`.
         - Validate that `candidateId` equals either `"candidateA"` or `"candidateB"`. If not, return a 400 error response.
         - Use a module-scoped in-memory object (e.g., `let votesStore = { candidateA: 0, candidateB: 0 }`) to record votes.
         - Increment the vote count for the selected candidate.
         - Return a JSON response with the updated vote counts.
         - Wrap logic in try/catch for unexpected errors.
       - **GET:**  
         - Return the current vote counts as a JSON object.
     - Ensure proper HTTP status codes and error messages are returned for invalid methods or errors.

4. **New File: src/app/result/page.tsx**
   - **Purpose:** Display the current vote counts for each candidate.
   - **Changes/Steps:**
     - Mark the page as a Client Component using `"use client";`.
     - On page load (using useEffect), send a GET request to `/api/vote` to fetch the current vote counts.
     - Display a modern, responsive dashboard that uses card components to show:
       - Candidate A: name, description, and vote count.
       - Candidate B: name, description, and vote count.
     - Use Tailwind CSS for the overall layout, ensuring proper spacing and text hierarchy.
     - Handle loading and error states gracefully (e.g., display a loading spinner or error message if the API fails).

---

## Additional Considerations and Best Practices

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Validate input both on client (e.g., disable vote button if already voted) and API levels; return clear error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes.
  - In the front-end vote function, handle non-200 responses and display error alerts using UI components.

- **UI/UX Enhancements:**  
  - Use clean, modern card designs without external icon libraries, relying solely on typography, colors, and layout.
  - Ensure navigation is simple and intuitive with clear links to Home and Results.
  - Provide visual feedback (e.g., button loading states, confirmation messages) when votes are submitted.
  - Use responsive design practices so the website works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Testing:**  
  - Validate API endpoint functionality using curl commands for both GET and POST methods.
  - Test client-side functionality (vote submission, duplicate vote prevention) to ensure robustness.

## Summary

- Created a new layout component (src/app/layout.tsx) to provide consistent UI and navigation.
- Developed the landing page (src/app/page.tsx) displaying two candidate cards with modern styling, proper placeholder images, and vote buttons.
- Implemented the API endpoint (src/app/api/vote/route.ts) supporting both vote submission (POST) and vote count retrieval (GET) with error handling.
- Added a results page (src/app/result/page.tsx) to show live vote counts using a responsive design.
- Ensured that all features include state validation, user feedback, and error handling aligned with best practices.
- Integrated Tailwind CSS from its CDN to maintain a clean, modern interface without external image services apart from approved placeholder images.

I will follow this plan thoroughly in my implementation and implement all the files in the plan.
